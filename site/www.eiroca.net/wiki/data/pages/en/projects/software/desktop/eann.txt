====== eANN ======
eANN is an implementation of several kind of neural networks was written with the intention of providing a (hopefully) easy to use, and easy to modify, OOP source code.

You can also have several different sized networks running simultaneously, each functioning independently of the others, or acting as inputs to other networks. 
It should also be very easy to modify the source so that neurons (or even whole layers) can be created/pruned during operation of the network, thus allowing dynamic expansion/contraction.

Networks Implemented:
  * Multi Layer Neural Network with Backpropagation
  * Competitive Neural Network
  * Radial Basis Neural Network
  * Progressive Radial Neural Network
  * Progressive Learning Neural Network

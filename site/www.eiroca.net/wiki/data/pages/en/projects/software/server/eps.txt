====== Development ======
===== Installation =====
Copy the contents of the zip file in the the Apache's htdocs directory.

Run a Web browser and type http://apache_domain/lib/eps/setup.php, you should see something like:

    Checking...
    GD Library ... OK v. 2
    testing directory ...
    Portal found(s):
    test_mobile
    test_web
  
You have finished to install the EPS portal framework, you can test a Web portal typing http://apache_domain/test_web/ and the mobile portal using http://apache_domain/test_mobile/.

===== Developing Portal =====
Currently no documentation is available :-(

See the test_xxx directory to see how the framework works. 

Just remember that for Web portals each page is a subdirectory inside the "pages" directory and after adding or removing a subdirectory you need to run the setup.php (or delete the portal/data/index.ini).

===== Advices =====
In real portals change the eps_config.inc of your portals in order to use logs, var directory. Don't to forget to make /lib and data, logs directory not public available (e.g. changing permission or .htaccess file).

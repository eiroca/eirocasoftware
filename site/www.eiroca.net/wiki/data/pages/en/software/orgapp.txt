====== OrgApp ======
{{:ico:orgapp.png |}}OrgApp is a Java library to handle and draw organization charts (organigrams).

The library has also an applet and a Swing Java client able to view an organization chart read from a file, in different formats (one of them based upon XML).

The applet supports charts with different layouts and boxes with hyperlinks, customizable colors, sizes, positions, ... and it is easy to embed in an HTML page.

<orgapp height=300 width="45%" url="/apps/orgapp/data1.sof" target="_blank"></orgapp>
<orgapp height=300 width="45%" url="/apps/orgapp/data2.sof" target="_blank"></orgapp>

To view the applet, you need a browser supporting Java Plug-in.

===== Requirements =====

OrgApp is also supported by: [[http://www.fbergeron.com|{{banner:fbergeron.png}}]]

====== Documentation ======
===== Organigram Applet =====
OrgApplet.jar is the applet to view the charts, the applet requires a browser supporting Java Plug-in (with a Java version higher than 1.5). The syntax is:

  <applet name="Organigram" code="OrganigramApplet.class" archive="URLTO_OrgApplet.jar">
    <param name="DataSource" value="URLTO_organigram.xml" />
    <param name="Target" value="_blank" />
    <param name="Data" value="embedded organization chart definition" />
    <param name="DataType" value="type of the definition" />
  </applet>

The parameters meaning is:
  * **DataSource** is the URL of the resource that contains the definition of the orgnanigram in any of the supported formats.
  * **Target** is the target used in links (unless a more specific will be present in the definition of the organigram node). 
  * **Data**, if DataSource is not defined this fileds holds the embedded definition of the chart in one of the supported format.
  * **DataType** is the type of the embedded definition (0=SOF, 1=TXT, 2=sitemap).

Check the source page to see a real usage.

===== Organigram Application =====
OrgApp.jar is a stand alone Java application to view the organization charts, that can be launched with the syntax:

  java -jar OrgApp.jar path_to_organigram.xml

where //path_to_organigram.xml// is obviously the path to the organigram in any of the supported format (format used is autodetected).

===== Organigram Converter =====
Convert.jar is a tool to transform an organization chart file from a format to another, the syntax:

  java -jar Convert.jar input_file output_type

//input_file// is the path of the input organigram

//output_type// is the type of the output organigram, with the following encoding: 0 simple organigram format, 1 text organigram, 2 sitemap.

The output will be printed to the screen, but can be redirected to a file (adding //> path_to_output// to the command).

The conversion form SOF format to another format can loose lot of information...

===== Organigram File format =====
OrgApp support three organigram file formats.

  * **SOF**, Simple Organigram Format is a XML based file format
  * **Text Format**, is a format where each raw is a node of the organigram
  * **Sitemap format**, as described in http://www.sitemaps.org

See data file of the [[http://www.eiroca.net/apps/orgapp/data1.xml|first organigram]] and of the [[http://www.eiroca.net/apps/orgapp/data2.xml|second one]] for examples of the file format or the SOF file format documentation present inside the //doc// directory of the distribution.

===== Server side helpers =====
The distribution contains server side library to easly integrate the applet.

//OrgApp.inc// is a PHP script to easly generate the HTML code necessary to draw the organization chart. Sample code:

  require_once("lib\OrgApp.inc");
  $OC = new OrgApp();
  //Set the dimension of the chats $OC->width=400;
  $OC->height=300;
  //Generate a chart, the data is a URL
  $OC->emitRef('data.xml');
  //Generate a chart, the data is read from a file and embedded in the html page
  $OC->emitFile('data.xml', 0);
  //Generate a chart with the data given
  $OC->emitData('<organigram><unit name="Doe, John" department="CEO" role="H"/></organigram>', 0);

===== Changes log =====
**Version 0.4.0**
  * PHP script to easly generate the applet in a HTML page
  * New layouts: TOP (e.g. organization chart), LEFT (e.g. classic tree chart), BOTTOM (e.g. family tree), RIGHT (e.g. direct elimination matches)
  * It is possible to specify line mode (direct or connector) and use name instead of numbers (e.g. mode="grow" instead of mode="2")
  * Applet can take the chart definition from "Data" and "DataType" parameters
  * Collapsible nodes
  * Added handling of collapsed flag in the GUI (right click toggles it)
  * Colors now can be expressed also with HTML color notation

**Version 0.3.0**
  * Compact aligment
  * Reading/writing organigram from sitemap.xml
  * Target of the link can be specified
  * Bugs fixing

**Version 0.2.0**
  * XML file format refactory
  * Writing organigram in XML format
  * Reading/writing organigram in text format
  * Adding Layout support (vertical/horizzontal)
  * //Box mode// introduced in layout manager in order to take less room to display the boxes. There are three modes:
    * MAX, where all boxes have the same size
    * MIN, where the boxes have the minimum size (granted that all boxes on the same row/col have the same size)
    * GROW, that grants that "boss" boxes are not lower than operative
  * Metadata handling including box type (boss highlight)
  * Individual box colors
  * Individual line font
  * Adding compact visualization

**Version 0.1.0**
  * 2005/11/20 - Improved scrollbars management.
  * 2005/11/20 - Improved the layout management and moved it to a dedicated class.
  * 2005/11/20 - Implemented basic individual line font management and horizontal alignment.
  * 2005/11/20 - Implemented cursor and tooltip update for boxes with a defined link.
  * 2005/11/13 - Implemented box hyperlinks (not on lines yet).
  * 2005/11/06 - Began to implement color, font and style for box lines.
  * 2005/11/06 - Introduced scrollbars.
  * 2005/10/30 - Added link tag for box lines.

During the pre-Hispanic times, this marsh city was the capital of the "Aztec" or "Mexican" empire.\\

Founded in 1321 with the name of "Tenochtitlan" by the priest "Tenoch", Tenochtitlan in the indigenous Nahuatl language means "the city of Tenoch". After the Spanish conquest, will retain its role of capital, to become today the largest urban concentration in the world. Mexico D.F. (Federal District) is the administrative, political, economic and social country; all is centralized in the capital, even if the government tries to create local agencies.\\

After 12 grueling hours of flight, we arrived at the airport, collected our luggage and took the car (unfortunately with automatic gear), then we settled into the hotel. To drive the car is better to know "something" for driving in Mexico ([[it:viaggi:messico#Raccomandazioni per la guida|recommendations for driving]]).

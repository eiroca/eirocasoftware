Be careful on this road which is full of curves, slippery and practically paved with "Topes" (bumps).\\

In this stage we did most unpleasant encounters, nothing to worry about, but we met groups of kids who tend ropes along the road, near the Topes (but not only) in order to stop the car and try to sell fruit or whatever. 
Not worrying, but very sad, we have often been afraid to let them hurt as they surround the car.\\

===== Agua Azul =====

<color navy>
The waterfalls of Agua Azul make a spectacle of beauty for all their blue color. 
You bathe with a little of caution, however, since the stream is fast. 
Many restaurants serving grilled fish caught locally. 
In April and May, waterfalls dress their most intesive blue.

However we arrived during the rainy season (between a cyclone and another), then the water was not too blue, but the game of waterfalls and pools is really impresionante.\\

Instead the air was very stifling, we are close to the tropical jungle.

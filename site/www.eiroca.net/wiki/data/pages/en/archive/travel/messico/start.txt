====== Faces of Mexico ======
[{{ viaggi:messico:Mappa_Messico.jpg?600 |**Ecco il nostro viaggio in Messico ...**}}]

===== You need to know =====
  * In winter the archaeological sites are open every day from 08:00 to 17:00  and until 18:00 in summer.
  * The museums are generally closed on Mondays.
  * The lunch time is from 14:00 to 15:00 or so.
  * Be prudent in indigenous regions with photographs, it is often forbidden to photograph the people for religious beliefs reasons. Respect the customs and manners!
  * The word //Zocalo//, is the term used to indicate the main square of the city.

===== Recommendations for driving =====
In Mexico, the road signs are generally the same as in Italy, but the indications are rather flimsy. The essential thing: to fill up with gasoline in the morning before leaving for anywhere.

==== Differences ====
  * Traffic lights are located just after the intersection, which is not very obvious.
  * In Mexico City, it is permissible  to turn right also with a red light (or left, according to the direction of traffic), with all the necessary precautions.
  * **In Mexico right of way does not exist**. The vehicle that is on the main road takes precedence. A vehicle that must pass a slowdown after the junction had to give way to others, who go straight will take precedence over who turns, with regard to roundabouts go there in "Mexican" way.
  * In town the speed is 60km/hour and 80km/hour on road with high flow of traffic.
  * On the highways, the speed is 110km/hour.
  * Mexicans drivers, especially of the truck, use the courtesy to indicate with arrows the possibility of surpassing or potential hazards (four arrows).  his is very useful on mountain roads with poor visibility!

==== Special precautions ====
On federal roads (those not subject to payment of tolls) you must pay particular attention:
  * to eople on foot or bicycles (without position lights)
  * to animals (cows, dogs, ...) crossing or parked safely on the roads
  * to slowdowns (//tope// in Spanish) that are numerous and generally bad or just highlighted. **Welcome to the roller coaster!**
  * to never leave anything on vehicles parked in the street. If you visit a site, with the luggage full, it is recommended first to leave your car locked and in a secure park.
  
==== Roadside assistance ====
Highways, and touristy federal roads have a (ree service of mechanical assistance: the "green angels", are easily recognizable by their green trucks bearing the logo of the Ministry of Tourism.

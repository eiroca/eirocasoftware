====== Mexico City (Sunday 26/08/07) ======
//
You can not see all of this huge city in a single day!\\

Mexico City often suffer from bad publicity even by tour operators. The tourist areas of the city and the districts themselves are not so dangerous as they say. However, it is better not to walk around the city wearing valuables and be careful.\\

The city traffic is very intense. When you do not know the city the best means of transport is by taxi. Taxis in front the hotels are recommended because the drivers are bilingual and can wait during your visits. Simply agree on a price before departure according to your itinerary.\\

To get an idea of how is the everyday live  in Mexico City is absolutely necessary to use one of the many buses that "fly" in the city traffic. They  are numerous and all crowded, the peculiarity is that there are not "stops", wherever you find one, just make a sign and you can literally "jump" on board.  To use the bus requires a fair amount of balance in order to remain standing, and a greater amount of agility and coordination for both go down and, above all, to go up (the brakes are used very little).\\

====== Oaxaca - Tuxtla Gutierrez (Saturday 01/09/07) ======
//
So far our journey has proceeded in mountain areas (Mexico City is located at 2240m above sea level), but this 550km shift has led us to the capital of Chiapas only 542m above sea level, the thermal shock was considerable and the humidity stifling when we crossed a vast wetland.

===== Tuxla Gutierrez =====

<color navy>
State capital of Chiapas since 1892, busy and modern town that is 85km from San Cristobal de Las Casas. The name of //Tuxtla//, in the language of the Indians, means "where rabbits abound".

//
For us this was only one stage of shift that has allowed us to better deal with the stage of the next day and quickly reach San Cristobal de Las Casas.

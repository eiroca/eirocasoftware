===== Zoo =====
//
At the zoo we went a bit as a joke to do a short tour before heading towards the city center... the joke lasted several hours. The zoo is huge, an uncountable number of races from all continents including aviary and reptile house that we could not see since the zoo closes at 17:00 (as virtually all museums in Mexico) and all visitors must be out.\\

It was exhausting.\\
